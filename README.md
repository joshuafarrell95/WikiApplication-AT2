# WikiApplication-AT2

## Project Description
This application was created as a part of my Certificate IV in Information Technology (Programming) at South Metropolitan TAFE in 2022. This program is a continuation of the [WikiApplication-AT1](https://github.com/joshuafarrell95/WikiApplication-AT1) project. This project uses an Information class object which can be used by a List`<Information>` to store an indefinite amount of records (memory permitting) with 4 attributes (Data Structure Name, Category, Structure and Description).

Information can be added, edited or deleted by the user, and when the Data Structre textbox is double clicked, all textboxes are cleared with a context sensitive message. When a record is deleted, the Information class object is removed from the List`<Information>`.

This program implements bubble sort and binary search algorithms.
