# WikiApplication-AT2

## Project Description
This application was created as a part of my Certificate IV in Information Technology (Programming) at South Metropolitan TAFE in 2022. This program is a continuation of the [WikiApplication-AT1](https://github.com/joshuafarrell95/WikiApplication-AT1)



uses a two-dimensional string array to store up to 12 records with 4 attributes (Data Structure Name, Category, Structure and Description). Upon loading the program, the array is initialised, output to a graphical ListView and sorted by Data Structure Name.

Records can be added, edited or deleted by the user, and when the Data Structre textbox is double clicked, all textboxes are cleared with a context sensitive message. When a record is deleted, empty records are sorted to the bottom of the ListView.

This program implements bubble sort and binary search algorithms.
